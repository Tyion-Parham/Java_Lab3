*Sigh*

The Design Patterns that I used were the Command and Facade. The facade pattern is responsible for handling all the stat relate;
getting the file that holds the data, passing the data into a list of "Game_Stats", making the table that holds the stats and making the sort panel.
The Command pattern is responsible for handling whenever the user wants to sort the data using the sort panel.
